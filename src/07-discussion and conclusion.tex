\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

We introduce \tool, an advanced, trojan-focused, explainable intrusion detection system that combats APTs. We are the first to detect intrusions against constructed behavioral profiles of system processes. \tool enhances detection precision and reduces false alarms by identifying inconsistencies in system processes. As a result of extensive experimentation, Refuter has demonstrated impressive performance metrics, including a 96.25\% precision rate and a 90.15\% recall rate, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and reliability against trojan-based APT attacks.

But our method still faces the following challenges that need to be addressed:

\noindent
{\bf Issues with Commands Generated by LLMs.}
Some commands cannot be executed in the system, and some are very difficult to run because they involve system processes. Also, it is challenging to determine whether some commands have been executed successfully.

\noindent
{\bf Incomplete Knowledge in LLMs.}
LLMs lack comprehensive knowledge. A lack of process information in LLMs can lead to detection failures. Using external security information to supplement missing data could be one solution.

\noindent
{\bf Hallucination Problems in LLMs.}
Although the accuracy of knowledge can be improved by using real logs and cross-session for validation, LLMs are difficult to completely eliminate illusions.
