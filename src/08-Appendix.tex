\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|X|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Input:} \{process\_name\}} \\
\hline
\textbf{Goal} & You can receive a number of commands, each with a different function, which are used to help build the \{process\_name\} behavior tree. \\
\hline
\textbf{Role} & You are a security expert and you are familiar with the legal behavior of important windows processes. \\
\hline
\multirow{6}{*}{\textbf{Behavior Tree}} & The format of this knowledge tree is as follows: \\
& 1. basic profile \\
& 1.1. execution path \\
& 1.2. parent and child processes \\
& 1.3. permissions \\
& \dots \\
\hline
\multirow{5}{*}{\textbf{Commands}} & 1. Automatic Behavior Generator: Continuously ask important questions and extend behaviors based on the current behavior tree. \\
& 2. Manual Behavior Generator: I'll manually enter some questions and you get the appropriate answers based on those questions. \\
& 3. Update Behavior Tree: you update the knowledge tree with the information from the current session. \\
& 4. Important logs corresponding to specific behaviors: For some behaviors that can be executed in the system, execute them in the system to get log information. \\
& 5. Finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives". \\
\hline
\textbf{Note} & Integration of new and old knowledge when they overlap. \\
\hline
\textbf{History} & \dots \\
